# Computer Security Final Project
## Topic 3: Intelligent Anti-Malware Software
### Requirements
1. Extract useful and meaningful features (WIN API calls, n-gram binaries, op instructions, etc.) from given PE files
2. Develop an ML algorithm to train model based on selected feature set(s). Then test it on the testing set
3. Implement a GUI tool for users to scan uploaded PE files. Program should conduct the predictions in the backend and display detection results (benign vs. malicious)

### Submissions
* Working code with GUI
* Report containing feature detection method, training/detection alg, and experimental results
* In class demo that shows detection of any executables in a format of PE 

### Resources
* Class Lectures 16-18
* [sklearn decision trees tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
